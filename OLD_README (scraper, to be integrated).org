** Ingestion process

In order to communicate the results of the scraping process to the ranker, the
ingestion process will be running inside the sandboxed environment, and
configured to receive data from the scraper via HTTP ~POST~ requests. It is
recommended to provide an API for receiving data, as well as errors and,
optionally, metrics.

Please note that even though here the scraper and ingestion containers are
running "side by side" in this example, in an actual deployment they will be
firewalled and e.g.  the scraper process will have no access to the Redis
instance inside the sandboxed environment (but it may have its own small Redis
instance to serve as a Celery broker)
